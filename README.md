# Portfolio
This repository is a portfolio of all the projects that I have worked on. Unless stated otherwise, I have worked on all these projects myself. Feel free to explore! You can contact me through my email, ishibu@ucsd.edu, for any questions or suggestions to improve any of my projects. 

Project 1:
The project was worked on by me and my friend, Bernard Wong. We used pandas, geopandas and learnt how to anlayse spatial structures. The project focused on the analysis of food deserts.

Project 2:
The project was worked on by me and my friend, Bernard Wong. We used pandas, arcgis and learn how to anlayse spatial structures through this project. The project focused on the analysis of bike-related accidents. We created regression models that analysed if certain locations resulted in more bike related accidents and if the parties involved in the collisions played any part in the severity of the collisions.

Project 3:
The project was worked on by me and my friend, Bernard Wong. We used pandas, geopandas and learnt how to anlayse raster structures through this project. The project focused on creating a suitability model by analysing data for the specific problem we were planing to tackle. We decided to build suitability model on areas where landslides were most likely to occur.
